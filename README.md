# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line based, tic-tac-toe game.
This game can be played by two players (X and O) where either of the players
can be a human or the computer. I was inspired by Kylie Ying (https://www.youtube.com/ycubed) for this project.

## Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x should be installed on your computer

## How to run it:

- Inside your bash terminal, opened in the preferred directory type: `git clone https://github.com/boseriddha/py-tic-tac-toe.git`
- This will download all the python files.
- Then in your terminal type: `python3 main.py`
- Enjoy the game!
